powershame-renderer (serperate repo)
    video-making daemon listens to server session manager. When a session is complete, downloads all session shots and compiles them into time-lapse. 
    deposits video at <location> and notifies server that video is ready
    runs on rabbitmq and ffmpeg

notifier

        - session started
        - video ready (10 minute warning)
